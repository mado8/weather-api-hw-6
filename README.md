# weather-dashboard
Using a third party api to request weather related parameters and executing them within my own custom application.

## Description
This weather dashboard allows a user to view the current weather in any searched city, save the recent searches for easy access to previous weather data, and to view a five day forecast for each city. This application was created using javascript and the OpenWeather api.
